## Programming and Scripting - Fisherâ€™s Iris Dataset
***
The project revolves around accessing and analyzing the [Iris](https://github.com/CarlosRigueti/pands-project/blob/main/iris.csv) dataset, a classic dataset frequently used in the field of data science and machine learning.[1] By working with this dataset, we aim to demonstrate a range of skills, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, visualization, and programming techniques using [Python](https://www.python.org/) within the Jupyter Notebook environment.[2]

### About this project:
***

It is [Iris](https://github.com/CarlosRigueti/pands-project/blob/main/iris.csv) dataset.
